    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      This online web app is for the modelling of the portion of the electron output factor that is dependent on the shape of the shielding insert mounted within the applicator. This allows modelling insert factors using only the measured factors already available at a centre. Should all outliers be removed from the data set the user might expect as low as 0.5% standard uncertainty for factor prediction with as little as 8 data points.

    <h4>Steps required to freeze your own version of this web app</h4>
      As I make improvements to this web app I will be updating this online version. 
      You may desire to not have the web app you are using day to day change on you.
      To achieve this you can create your own version of the server and your own version of the web app.
      
      For now this will require a bit of your own working out until I provide further instructions.
